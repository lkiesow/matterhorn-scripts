The attached files replace all Matterhorn start, stop and sysvinit scripts: 

/usr/sbin/matterhorn
	The new start and stop script. It can run Matterhorn both as daemon and
	interactively. It only allows one Matterhorn to run at the same time and
	keeps track of its process id for shutdown, … 

/etc/init.d/matterhorn
	The new SysV-Init script. It now supports all necessary options (start,
	stop, status, restart, condrestart, …) and will return a correct code. 

/etc/matterhorn/service.conf
	The configuration file. Configuration are done using this file only. Do not
	alter the executable files. Using this configuration files one can specify
	the matterhorn directories, user, etc.
	If both files exists, the configuration frm /etc is more “important”. This
	means that values from /etc...service.conf will overwrite those set in
	/opt...service.conf. However, please choose one location.
